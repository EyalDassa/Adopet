## Overview

This project is part of an Android development course focused on building comprehensive, real-world mobile applications.

**Adopet** is designed to facilitate the process of pet adoption. Users can browse available pets, mark their favorites, and contact pet owners directly through the app. The app also allows users to manage their profiles and to view and manage their favorite pets.

### Key Objectives of the Project:

- **Hands-on Experience**: Gain practical experience in Android development, from design to implementation.
- **UI/UX Design**: Implement a user-friendly interface using Material Design principles, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Database Integration**: Use Firebase Realtime Database for storing and retrieving pet listings, user profiles, and favorites.
- **State Management**: Manage state effectively across different activities and fragments, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience.
- **Real-world Application**: Simulate a real-world scenario where users interact with a mobile application to perform useful tasks, such as finding pets for adoption.

### Technologies and Tools Used:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Android Studio**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding, debugging, and testing.
- **Firebase**: Used for backend services, including Realtime Database, user authentication and storage.
- **Material Design Components**: Implemented for a modern and intuitive user interface.
- **Glide**: Used for efficient image loading and caching within the app.

### Learning Outcomes:

- **Understanding Android Lifecycle**: Comprehensive understanding of Android activity and fragment lifecycles and how to manage them.
- **UI/UX Best Practices**: Applying Material Design guidelines to create a polished and user-friendly interface.
