- **State Management**: Manage state effectively across different activities and fragments, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience.
- **Real-world Application**: Simulate a real-world scenario where users interact with a mobile application to perform useful tasks, such as finding pets for adoption.

### Technologies and Tools Used:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Android Studio**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding, debugging, and testing.
- **Firebase**: Used for backend services, including Realtime Database, user authentication and storage.
- **Material Design Components**: Implemented for a modern and intuitive user interface.
- **Glide**: Used for efficient image loading and caching within the app.

### Learning Outcomes:

- **Understanding Android Lifecycle**: Comprehensive understanding of Android activity and fragment lifecycles and how to manage them.
